# Overview

This game was originally made as a project for an assessment, meant to fit the "Games for Change" theme, but it didnâ€™t really meet that goal. You play as a character jumping and aiming as high as they can. The plan was to add challenging obstacles like falling platforms and the tough jumps that needed to be made.

In the end, though, I focused more on parkour instead of adding enemies or visual effects like bloom and shadows. The game is mainly about teaching players how to move and play through a tutorial, rather than having complex visuals or enemy encounters. If I had finished it, I would have added those things, but it stayed as a parkour-focused game with a learning experience.
