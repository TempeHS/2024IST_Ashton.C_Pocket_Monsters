# Overview

This game was originally made as a project for an assessment, meant to fit the "Games for Change" theme, but it didn’t really meet that goal. You play as a character jumping and aiming as high as they can. The plan was to add challenging obstacles like falling platforms and the tough jumps that needed to be made.

In the end, though, I focused more on parkour instead of adding enemies or visual effects like bloom and shadows. The game is mainly about teaching players how to move and play through a tutorial, rather than having complex visuals or enemy encounters. If I had finished it, I would have added those things, but it stayed as a parkour-focused game with a learning experience.

# Features

I used [these tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYg07K-5ONU&list=PLyHH_4nd7MkI-jgXnEw3nSVzAqeftSSyM) for many of the features in the game. They were helpful, especially for basic movement code, as I was still learning C# and Unity. The tutorials were easy to follow, and I adjusted the code to fit what I needed for the game.

### Movement and Jumping

Movement and jumping were the first things I added to the game. I followed the tutorials closely and didn’t have much trouble. Most of the issues I had were small mistakes like typos, which were easy to fix.

### Dashing

Dashing was the second thing I worked on, as I thought it would be a good idea to add to make the parkour game more complex and challenging. The main issue I faced was deciding whether or not to include a visual trail during the dash.

### One Way Platforms

One way platforms are one of the most frequently used elements in the game. I used them to help players go higher and to increase the challenge, giving a sense of climbing toward the sky to suit the game’s theme.

### Falling Platforms

Falling platforms add an extra level of difficulty and excitement. When the player steps on these platforms, they fall after a short delay, forcing the player to move quickly and plan their jumps. This mechanic was added to keep the gameplay dynamic and unpredictable, increasing the tension as the player progresses through the levels.
